"class=\"theme_description\"><h2>About</h2><p>Leatherbound is a fluid-width, "
"three-column theme for Moodle 2.0 that was created by Patrick "
"Malley.<h2>Tweaks</h2><p>This theme is built upon both Base and Canvas, two "
"parent themes included in the Moodle core. If you want to modify this theme, "
"we recommend that you first duplicate it then rename it before making your "
"changes. This will prevent your customized theme from being overwritten by "
"future Moodle upgrades, and you'll still have the original files if you make "
"a mess. More information on modifying themes can be found in the <a href=\"h"
"ttp://docs.moodle.org/en/Theme\">MoodleDocs</a>.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>This "
"theme was coded and is maintained by Patrick Malley of NewSchool Learning. "
"He can be contacted by email at contact@newschoollearning.com. "
