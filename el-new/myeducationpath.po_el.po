"Configure MyEducationPath.com integration. <br>This plugin is used to add "

"from your students (in form of comments for your course in the "
"directory).<br>If you decide to add a course to the directory then go to "
"course and add new activity \"MyEducationPath\" to any section (recomended to "
"last section).Once an activity as added you need to decide if you want your "
"students leave comments about a course. If <b>Yes</b> then make the activity "
"visible for students. If <b>No</b> then hide the activity and students will "
"not see it (but the course still can be added to "
"MyEducationPath.com)<br><br>The integration can work in two modes - "
"<b>Active</b> and <b>Passive</b>.<br><b>Active</b> mode means for every "
"course you need to open the activity as admin/teacher and confirm \"Add the "
"course to the directory\". Only after this the course will be added.<br>In "
"<b>Passive</b> mode you need to get import URI, go to your "
"MyEducationPath.com profile settings and save the URI.  After this "
"MyEducationPath.com will check your Moodle courses regularry and import all "
"new/updated courses (only courses where this module is added as activity). "
"Your import URI is <b>http://youmoodlesite.com/pathtomoodle/mod/myeducationp"
"ath/import.php</b><br>\"Active\" mode is always enabled. \"Passive\" will work "
"only if you save import URI in your MyEducationPath.com profile settings "
"page.<br>To start using your integration you need to <a "
"href=\"http://myeducationpath.com/page/register.htm?acctype=v\" "
"target=\"_blank\">register</a> on MyEducationPath.com as Online Courses Vendor "
"and get API key (on profile page).<br><br>\tNOTE. Only couses where this "
"activity is added will be added to MyEducationPath.com directory. For every "
"course folowing data is posted to the directory: course name, description, "
"instructors names (teachers), price, start date (if is set). No any "
