"<div class=\"theme_description\"><h2>About</h2><p>Education Book is a fluid-"
"width, three-column theme for Moodle 2.0 that was created by "
"99Template.com.<h2>Tweaks</h2><p>This theme is built upon both Base and "
"Canvas, two parent themes included in the Moodle core. If you want to modify "
"this theme, we recommend that you first duplicate it then rename it before "
"making your changes. This will prevent your customized theme from being "
"overwritten by future Moodle upgrades, and you'll still have the original "
"files if you make a mess.</div></div>"
