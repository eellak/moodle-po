"With Certainty Based Marking (CBM) getting every question correct with C=1 "
"(low certainty) gives a grade of 100%. Grades may be as high as 300% if "
"every question is correct with C=3 (high certainty). Misconceptions "
"(confident wrong responses) lower grades much more than wrong responses that "
"are acknowledged to be uncertain. This may even lead to negative overall "
"grades.\n"
"\n"
"**Accuracy** is the % correct ignoring certainty but weighted for the "
"maximum mark of each question. Successfully distinguishing more and less "
"reliable responses gives a better grade than selecting the same certainty "
"for each question. This is reflected in the **CBM Bonus**. **Accuracy** + "
"**CBM Bonus** is a better measure of knowledge than **Accuracy**. "
"Misconceptions can lead to a negative bonus, a warning to look carefully at "
"what is and is not known."
