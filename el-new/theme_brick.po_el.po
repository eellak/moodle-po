"<div class=\"theme_description\"> <h2>About</h2> <p>Brick is a two-column, "
"fluid-width theme for Moodle 2.0. You can change the theme colour scheme via "
"the theme settings page.</p> <h2>Tweaks</h2> <p>This theme is built upon "
"both Base and Canvas, two parent themes included in the Moodle core. If you "
"wish to modify aspects of this theme beyond the settings offered, we advise "
"creating a new theme that uses this theme, Base, and Canvas all as parents. "
"This will ensure updates to any of those themes in the core will find their "
"way into your new theme.</p> <h2>Credits</h2> <p>This theme was coded and is "
"maintained by John Stabinger of NewSchool Learning. He can be contacted by "
"email at contact@newschoollearning.com. </p> <h2>License</h2> <p>This, and "
"all other themes included in the Moodle core, are licensed under the <a "
