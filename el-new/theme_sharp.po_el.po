"class=\"theme_description\"><h2>About</h2><p>Sharp is a two-column, fluid-"
"width theme coded for Moodle 2.x. It makes use of custom menus that appear "
"above the site title on every page, giving it a user friendly structure. It "
"comes in a variety of colors and is designed to provide a lower contrast "
"interface for reading while maintaining clear visibility.  It also includes "
"a basic settings page allowing you to change your custom logo, link color, "
"add a tagline above the site name on the front page, and add text to the "
"footer.</p><h2>Parents</h2><p>This theme is built upon both Base and Canvas, "
"two parent themes included in the Moodle core. If you wish to modify "
"aspects of this theme beyond the settings offered, we advise creating a new "
" theme using this theme, Base and Canvas all as parents so updates to any "
"of those themes in the core will find their way into your new "
"theme.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>This theme is based on fusion themes, it was "
"originally created by Digital Nature(hello@digitalnature.ro) before being "
"ported to Moodle by Patrick Malley (patrick@newschoollearning.com). Sharp "
"was created by 3i Logic.</div></div>"
