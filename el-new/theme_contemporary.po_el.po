"three-column theme for Moodle 2.x. It has a crisp and sophisticated look, "
"and a setting page where you can change your custom banner, link color, "
"footer text and add custom CSS.<h2>Tweaks</h2><p>This theme is built upon "
"both Base and Canvas, two parent themes included in the Moodle core. If you "
"want to modify this theme, we recommend that you first duplicate it then "
"rename it before making your changes. This will prevent your customized "
"theme from being overwritten by future Moodle upgrades, and you will still "
"have the original files if you make a mess. More information on modifying "
"themes can be found in the <a "
"href=\"http://docs.moodle.org/en/Theme\">MoodleDocs</a>.</p><h2>Credits</h2>  "
"<p>This theme is based on Moodle Serenity theme, customized by 3i "
