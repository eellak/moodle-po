"The Adaptive Quiz activity enables a teacher to create quizes that "
"efficiently measure the takers' abilities. Adaptive quizes are comprised  of "
"questions selected from the question bank that are tagged with a score of "
"their difficulty. The questions are chosen to match the estimated ability "
"level of the  current test-taker. If the test-taker succeeds on a question, "
"a more challenging question is presented next. If the test-taker answers a "
"question incorrectly, a less-challenging question is presented next. This "
"technique will develop into a sequence of questions converging on the test-"
"taker's effective ability level. The quiz stops when the test-taker's "
"ability is determined to the required accuracy.\n"
"\n"
"This activity is best suited to determining an ability measure along a "
"unidimensional scale. While the scale can be very broad, the questions must "
"all provide a measure of ability or aptitude on the same scale. In a "
"placement test for example, questions low on the scale that novices are able "
"to answer correctly should also be answerable by experts, while questions "
"higher on the scale should only be answerable by experts or a lucky guess. "
"Questions that do not discriminate between takers of different abilities on "
"will make the test ineffective and may provide inconclusive results.\n"
"\n"
"Questions used in the Adaptive Quiz must\n"
"\n"
" * be automatically scored as correct/incorrect\n"
" * be tagged with their difficulty using 'adpq_' followed by a positive "
"integer that is within the range for the quiz\n"
"\n"
"The Adaptive Quiz can be configured to\n"
"\n"
" * define the range of question-difficulties/user-abilities to be measured. "
"1-10, 1-16, and 1-100 are examples of valid ranges.\n"
" * define the precision required before the quiz is stopped. Often an error "
"of 5% in the ability measure is an appropriate stopping rule\n"
" * require a minimum number of questions to be answered\n"
" * require a maximum number of questions that can be answered\n"
