"Dyslexia, also known as reading disorder, is characterized by trouble with "
"reading unrelated to problems with overall intelligence. Different people "
"are affected to varying degrees. Problems may include difficulties in "
"spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, \"sounding out\" words in the "
"head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads. "
"Often these difficulties are first noticed at school. When someone who "
"previously could read loses their ability, it is known as alexia. The "
"difficulties are involuntary and people with this disorder have an "
"unaffected desire to learn.</br>\n"
"The cause of dyslexia is believed to involve both genetic and environmental "
"factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people with "
"attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with "
"similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood as the result "
"of a traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms "
"are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia is diagnosed "
"through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. "
"Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by insufficient "
"teaching; or either hearing or vision problems.</br>\n"
"Treatment involves adjusting teaching methods to meet the person's needs. "
"While not curing the underlying problem, it may decrease the degree of "
"symptoms. Treatments targeting vision are not effective. Dyslexia is the "
"most common learning disability, affecting 3â€“7 % of the population; however, "
"up to 20% may have some degree of symptoms. While dyslexia is more often "
"diagnosed in men, it has been suggested that it affects men and women "
"equally. Dyslexia occurs in all areas of the world. Some believe that "
"dyslexia should be best considered as a different way of learning, with both "
"benefits and downsides."
