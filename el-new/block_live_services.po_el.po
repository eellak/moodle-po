"    <h3 id=\"WLID1\">What is a Windows Live ID?</h3>\n"
"    <p>Windows Live ID gives you access to Microsoft&reg;&nbsp;services "
"including Windows Live Hotmail&reg;, Windows Live Calendar, Windows Live "
"Messenger, and bing&trade;&nbsp;search. You can create your Windows Live ID "
"(e-mail and password) once, then use it to sign in to those services and "
"others such as your Moodle site.\n"
"To learn more about Windows Live ID, see <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https:/"
"/accountservices.passport.net/ppnetworkhome.srf?vv=650&lc=1033\\\">Simplify "
"your sign in.</a></p>\n"
"    <h3 id=\"WLID2\">How do I get a Windows Live ID?</h3>\n"
"\n"
"    <p>You can sign up for a Windows Live ID from the Moodle login site or "
"<a target=\\\"blank\\\" "
"href=\\\"https://signup.live.com/signup.aspx?rollrs=12&lic=1\\\">go online and "
"create an account.</a></p>\n"
"    <h3 id=\"WLID3\">How do I change my Windows Live ID password?</h3>\n"
"    <p>To help protect your personal information, it's recommended that you "
"change your password frequently.\n"
"<br/>To change your password:\n"
"<ol>\n"
"<li>Sign in to your account summary page with your Windows Live ID.</li>\n"
"<li>Under <strong>Password reset information</strong>, click "
"<strong>Change</strong> next to <strong>Password</strong>.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>Verify that the e-mail address in the <strong>Windows Live ID</strong> "
"field is correct, and then type your old password in the <strong>Old "
"password</strong> box.</li>\n"
"<li>Enter and confirm a new password.</li>\n"
"<li>To set your password to expire every 72 days, click the <strong>Make my "
"password expire every 72 days</strong> check box, and then click "
"<strong>Save</strong>.</li>\n"
"\n"
"</ol>\n"
"Note:  Some services require you to change your password every 72 days. If "
"you use one of these services, automatic password expiration may be set "
"already and can't be changed.</p>\n"
"    <h3 id=\"WLID4\">What should I do if I forget my Windows Live ID "
"password?</h3>\n"
"    <p>First follow these steps:\n"
"<ol>\n"
"<li>In the sign in area, click <strong>Forgot your password?</strong></li>\n"
"<li>In the <strong>E-mail address</strong> field, enter the address you used "
"to create your Windows Live ID.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>Enter the characters that you see in the <strong>Picture</strong> field, "
"and then click <strong>Continue</strong>.</li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"Then, you have two options to identify or reset your password. You can send "
"yourself a message or answer your secret question.\n"
"To send yourself a message:\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Click <strong>Send yourself a password reset e-mail message.</strong> "
"</li>\n"
"<li>If you added an alternate e-mail to your credentials, click <strong>Send "
"an e-mail message to my alternate e-mail address</strong>, and then click "
"<strong>Send Message</strong>. Or, if you use the Save my e-mail address and "
"password option when you sign in, click the option to send an e-mail "
"message to your usual e-mail address, then click Send Message. You'll be "
"able to access your e-mail, because your password was automatically "
"saved.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>Open your alternate e-mail account, and follow the instructions in the "
"password reset e-mail message.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"To answer your secret question:\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Click <strong>Provide account information and answer your secret "
"question.</strong></li>\n"
"<li>From the <strong>Country/Region</strong> menu, select the name of your "
"country or region, enter your ZIP code or postal code if prompted to do so. "
"Then, in the <strong>Secret Answer</strong> area, enter your answer to the "
"question in the Question area. </li>\n"
"<li>Click <strong>Continue.</strong></li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>Enter and confirm a new password, and then click "
"<strong>Continue</strong>.</li>\n"
"<li>Click <strong>Done</strong></li>\n"
"</ul>\n"

"    <h3 id=\"Moodle1\">How is my Windows Live ID used in Moodle?</h3>\n"
"    <p>The Microsoft Live Services Plug-in for Moodle gives you the option "
"to sign in to your Moodle using your Windows Live ID. In addition, when "
"you're signed in to your Moodle you can also quickly access some popular "
"Windows Live services such as Windows Live Mail, Calendar, and "
"Messenger.</p>\n"
"\n"
"    <h3 id=\"Moodle2\">Why do I have to allow Windows Live access to my Moodle "
"site?</h3>\n"
"    <p>The first time you sign in to your Moodle using your Windows Live ID "
"you'll need to give the site access to view your Windows Live Messenger "
"contacts list, so that Windows Live can send your settings through your "
"Moodle. </p>\n"
"    <h3 id=\"Moodle3\">Do I have to create a new e-mail address or can I use "
"my current e-mail address?</h3>\n"
"    <p>You can use your current e-mail address or sign up for a free Windows "
"Live e-mail address. The choice is yours. Keep in mind that some features "
"are only available for certain e-mail accounts. For example, e-mail access "
"is limited to Hotmail, MSN&reg;, and Live addresses. </p>\n"
"    <h3 id=\"Moodle4\">How do I link my Moodle account to my Windows Live ID? "
"</h3>\n"
"    <p>This may have been done for you already by your Moodle administrator. "
"If not, you can link your Moodle and Windows Live ID accounts together with "
"the following steps:\n"
"\n"
"<br/><br/><strong>Note:</strong> If you don't already have a Windows Live "
"ID, you'll need to sign up for one before continuing.\n"
"<br/>To link your Moodle and Windows Live ID accounts together:\n"
"<ol>\n"
"<li>Log into Moodle.</li>\n"
"<li>Click your name in the upper-right corner to view your account.</li>\n"
"<li>Click <strong>Edit Profile.</strong></li>\n"
"<li>Click <strong>Show Advanced.</strong></li>\n"
"<li>In the <strong>MSN ID</strong> field, enter your Windows Live ID.</li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>Click <strong>Update Profile.</strong></li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"</p>\n"
"    <h3 id=\"Moodle5\">What should I do if I can't sign in? </h3>\n"
"    <p>If you can't sign into Moodle with your Windows Live ID, try the "
"following:<br/>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Make sure that your whole e-mail address (before and after the @ sign) "
"is entered in the <strong>Email address</strong> field. </li>\n"
"\n"
"<li>Make sure that you entered your password correctly. Passwords are case "
"sensitive. If you've forgotten your password, try to reset it. </li>\n"
"<li>If you haven't used your Hotmail or MSN e-mail address for a long time, "

"target=\\\"_blank\\\">visit the Hotmail registration Web site</a> to open a new "
"account. </li>\n"
"<li>Your user name may become unavailable if it doesn't include msn or "
"hotmail domain after the @ sign, and you haven't used the account for more "
"than a year. To sign up for new credentials, visit the Windows Live ID Web "
"site. </li>\n"
"<li>Make sure that you have configured your browser to allow cookies. If "
"your browser doesn't allow cookies, you can't sign in with your Windows Live "
"ID. </li>\n"
