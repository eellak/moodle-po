"\t\t<h2>About</h2>\n"
"\t\t<p>Arialist is a very clean and simple two-column, fluid-width theme for "
"Moodle 2.0.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t<h2>Tweaks</h2>\n"
"\t\t<p>This theme is built upon both Base and Canvas, two parent themes "
"included in the Moodle core. If you want to modify this theme, we recommend "
"that you first duplicate it, then rename it before making your changes. This "
"will prevent your customized theme from being overwritten by future Moodle "
"upgrades, and you'll still have the original files if you make a mess. More "
"information on modifying themes can be found in the <a "
"href=\"http://docs.moodle.org/en/Theme\">MoodleDocs</a>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t<h2>Credits</h2>\n"
"\t<p>This theme was coded and is maintained by Patrick Malley of NewSchool "
"Learning. He can be contacted by email at contact@newschoollearning.com. "
