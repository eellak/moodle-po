"With Certainty Based Marking (CBM), all correct at C=1 (low certainty)\n"
"        will give a Moodle Grade of 100%. Grades may be as high as 300% if "
"every question is correct with C=3\n"
"       (high certainty). Simple Moodle Grades with CBM are not easily "
"compared with Grades without CBM,\n"
"        unless converted to CB Grades (below).\n"
"\n"
"**Accuracy** is the percentage correct, ignoring certainty but weighted with "
"the max values assigned to each question.\n"
"        If the student successfully distinguishes more and less reliable "
"answers, this is reflected in a **CB Bonus**,\n"
"        which  is positive if the total marks are higher than could be "
"obtained with the same answers at uniform certainty.\n"
"        The **CB Accuracy** (=Accuracy + Bonus) is the clearest measure of "
"knowledge. The **CB Grade** is the\n"
"        CB Accuracy multiplied by the maximum grade assigned to the quiz."
