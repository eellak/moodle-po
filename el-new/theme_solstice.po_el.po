"<div class=\"clearfix\"><div class=\"theme_screenshot\"><h2>Solstice</h2><img "
"src=\"solstice/pix/screenshot.png\" /><h2>About</h2><p>Solstice is a three "
"column fluid-width theme for Moodle 2.0. <h2>Tweaks</h2><p>This theme is "
"built upon both Base and Canvas, two parent themes included in the Moodle "
"core. If you want to modify this theme, we recommend that you first "
"duplicate it, then rename it before making your changes. This will prevent "
"your customized theme from being overwritten by future Moodle upgrades, and "
"you'll still have the original files if you make a mess. More information on "
"modifying themes can be found in the <a "
