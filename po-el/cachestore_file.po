"If enabled files (cached items) will be stored in a single directory rather "
"than being broken up into multiple directories.<br />\n"
"Enabling this will speed up file interactions but comes at the cost of "
"increased risk of hitting file system limitations.<br />\n"
"It is advisable to only turn this on if the following is true:<br />\n"
"  - If you know the number of items in the cache is going to be small enough "
"that it won't cause issues on the file system you are running with.<br />\n"
"  - The data being cached is not expensive to generate. If it is then "
"sticking with the default may still be the better option as it reduces the "
"chance of issues."
