"fluid-width theme for Moodle 2.0. <h2>Tweaks</h2><p>This theme is built upon "
"both Base and Canvas, two parent themes included in the Moodle core. If you "
"want to modify this theme, we recommend that you first duplicate it, then "
"rename it before making your changes. This will prevent your customized "
"theme from being overwritten by future Moodle upgrades, and you'll still "
"have the original files if you make a mess. More information on modifying "
"themes can be found in the <a href=\"http://docs.moodle.org/en/Theme\">MoodleD"
"ocs</a>.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>This theme was coded and is maintained by "
