"class=\"theme_description\"><h2>About</h2><p>Sky High is a fluid-width, "
"three-column (blog style) theme for Moodle 2.0.<h2>Tweaks</h2><p>This theme "
"is built upon both Base and Canvas, two parent themes included in the Moodle "
"core. If you want to modify this theme, we recommend that you first "
"duplicate it then rename it before making your changes. This will prevent "
"your customized theme from being overwritten by future Moodle upgrades, and "
"you'll still have the original files if you make a mess. More information on "
"modifying themes can be found in the <a "
"href=\"http://docs.moodle.org/en/Theme\">MoodleDocs</a>.</p><h2>Credits</h2>\t"
"<p>This theme was designed by Julian Ridden (julian@moodle.com.au). It was "
"coded and is maintained by John Stabinger of NewSchool Learning "
"(contact@newschoollearning.com). </p><h2>License</h2><p>This, and all other "
