"<h2>Introduction</h2>\n"
"<p>Here you set the files that are needed to prepare the execution,\n"
"debug or assessment of a submission. This includes scripting files,\n"
"program test files and data files.</p>\n"
"<h2>Default script to run or debug</h2>\n"
"<p>If you don't set script files for run or  debug submissions, the system\n"
"will resolve the language you use (based on file name extensions) and use a\n"
"predefined script.\n"
"<h2>Automatic evaluation</h2>\n"
"<p>The incorporates features to facilitate the evaluation of student's "
"submissions.\n"
"This feature allows to run the student program and check its output for a "
"given input.\n"
"To set up the evaluation cases you must populate the file "
"&quot;vpl_evaluate.cases&quot;.\n"
"<p>The file \"vpl_evaluate.cases\" has the following format:\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li> \"<strong>case </strong>= Description of case\": Optional. Set an start "
"of test case definition.</li>\n"
"<li> \"<strong>input </strong>= text\": can use several lines. Ends with other "
"instruction.</li>\n"
"<li> \"<strong>output </strong>= text\": can use several lines. Ends with "
"other instruction. A case can have differents correct output. There are "
"three types of output: numbers, text and exact test:\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li> <strong>number</strong>: defined as sequence of numbers (integers and "
"floats). Only numbers in the output are checked, other text are ignored. "
"Floats are checked with tolerance</li>\n"
"<li> <strong>text</strong>: defined as text without double quote. Only words "
"are checked and the rest of chars are ignored, the comparation is case-"
"insensitive </li>\n"
"<li> <strong>exact text</strong>: defined as text into double quote. The "
"exact match is used to test the output.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"</li>\n"
"<li> \"<strong>grade reduction</strong> = [value|percentage%]\" : By default "
"an error reduces student's grade\n"
"(starts with maxgrade) by (grade_range/number of cases) but with this "
"instruction you can change\n"
"the reduction value or percentage.</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"</p>\n"
"<h2>General use</h2>\n"
"<p>A new file can be added by writing its name in the box  &quot;<b>Add "
"file</b>&quot;\n"
"and then clicking on the button &quot;<b>Add file</b>&quot;.</p>\n"
"<p>An existing file can be uploaded by means of the  &quot;<b>Upload "
"file</b>&quot;.<p>All the added  or uploaded files can\n"
"be edited, and all of them, except the three scripting files mentioned\n"
"below, can be renamed or deleted.</p>\n"
"<h2>Manual run, execute or evaluation</h2>\n"
"<p>Three scripting files to prepare each of the actions may be set.\n"
"These files have predefined names: <b>vpl_run.sh</b> (execution),\n"
"<b>vpl_debug.sh</b>  (debug) and <b>vpl_evaluate.sh</b> (assessment).</p>\n"
"<p>The execution of any of those scripting files should generate a\n"
"file named <b>vpl_execution</b>.\n"
"This file must be a binary executable or a script beginning with "
"&quot;#!/bin/sh &quot;.\n"
"The non-generation of this file impedes to run the selected action.</p>\n"
"<p>If the activity that you are configuring is \"based on\" other activity,\n"
"the files of the base activity are added automatically.\n"
"The contents of the vpl_run.sh, vpl_debug.sh and vpl_evaluate.sh files\n"
"are concatenated from the deepest level of \"based on\" to the current.</P>\n"
"<p>Finally, the file <b>vpl_environment.sh</b> is automatically added.\n"
"This scripting file contain information about the submission.\n"
"The information come as environment variables: </p>\n"
"<ul> <li> LANG:  used language. </li>\n"
"<li> LC_ALL: same value as LANG. </li>\n"
"<li> VPL_MAXTIME: maximum execution time in seconds. </li>\n"
"<li> VPL_FILEBASEURL: URL to access the files of the course. </li>\n"
"<li> VPL_SUBFILE#:  each name of the files submitted by the student. # "
"Ranges from 0 to number of submitted files. </Li>\n"
"<li> VPL_SUBFILES: list of all submitted files. </li>\n"
"<li> VPL_VARIATION + id: where id is the variation order starting with 0 and "
"the value is the value of the variation. </li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"If the action requested is evaluation, then the following vars are added "
"too.\n"
"<ul>\n"
"\t<li>VPL_MAXTIME: max time of execution in seconds.</li>\n"
"\t<li>VPL_MAXMEMORY: max memmory usable</li>\n"
"\t<li>VPL_MAXFILESIZE: max file size in byte that can be create.</li>\n"
"\t<li>VPL_MAXPROCESSES: max number of procceses that can be run "
"simultaneous.</li>\n"
"\t<Li>VPL_FILEBASEURL: URL to the course files.</Li>\n"
"\t<li>VPL_GRADEMIN: Min grade for this activity</li>\n"
"\t<li>VPL_GRADEMAX: Max grade for this activity</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<h2>Assessment result</h2>\n"
"<p>Evaluation output is processed to extract, if possible, comments and a "
"proposed grade for the assessment.\n"
"Comments can be set in two ways: with a line comment defined by a line "
"beginning with 'Comment :=&gt;&gt;' or\n"
"with block comments starting with a line containing only '&lt;|--' and "
"ending with a line containing only '--|&gt;'.\n"
"The grade is taken from the last line that begins with 'Grade :=&gt;&gt;'.\n"
