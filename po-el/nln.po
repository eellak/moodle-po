"The NLN materials are small, flexible 'bite-sized' episodes of learning. "
"They are not whole courses but are designed to support a wide range of "
"subject and topic areas. The materials adopt a range of approaches involving "
"some knowledge acquisition, a chance to practice and absorb, and some form "
"of assessment to check that the learning has been understood and the "
"learning outcome(s) achieved.\n"
"\n"
"The materials give learners things to do and a chance to think for "
"themselves. They are designed to be fun. Learners can make mistakes but can "
"try again. There is plenty of in-built help if they get stuck and "
"opportunities to go back and revise. Many of the materials include games or "
"quizzes. Accessibility options are available on many of the materials to "
"suit learners' individual needs. The materials are also designed to appeal "
"to the different learning styles of students.\n"
"\n"
"This activity module allows teachers to find and add NLN learning objects to "
"their Moodle courses with a minimum of effort."
