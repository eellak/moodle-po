"\t\t<h2>About</h2>\n"
"\t\t<p>Fusion is a two-column, fluid-width theme coded for Moodle 2.0. It "
"makes use of custom menus that appear above the site title on every page. It "
"also includes a basic settings page allowing you to change link color, add "
"a tagline above the site name on the front page, and add text to the "
"footer.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t<h2>Parents</h2>\n"
"\t\t<p>This theme is built upon both Base and Canvas, two parent themes "
"included in the Moodle core. If you wish to modify aspects of this theme "
"beyond the settings offered, we advise creating a new  theme using this "
"theme, Base and Canvas all as parents so updates to any of those themes in "
"the core will find their way into your new theme.</p>\n"
"\n"
"\t\t<h2>Credits</h2>\n"

"(hello@digitalnature.ro) before being ported to Moodle by Patrick Malley "
