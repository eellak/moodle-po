"<h1>Rocket</h1>\n"
"<img src=\"rocket/pix/screenshot.jpg\"/>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>About</h2>\n"
"<p>Rocket is a three column fixed-width theme for Moodle 2.1+ originally "
"designed by Julian Ridden to take Moodle themes to a more website focused "
"look and feel. While the design is original, much of the CSS and the icons "
"have come from <a "
"href=\"http://moodle.org/user/profile.php?id=299683\"><strong>Saun "
"Daubney's</strong></a> fantastic Aardvark theme and also with support in the "
"forums from<a "
"href=\"http://moodle.org/user/profile.php?id=713800\"><strong>Mary "
"Evans</strong></a>.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>The theme is highly customisable through Moodle's theme settings. You can "
"adjust images, text and colurs all without changing code. The theme also "
"has a function that means that when users log in, courses they are enrolled "
"in will show up in the dropdown 'custom menu' at the top of the screen.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Please note that this is listed as a Beta version. There will probably be "
"some bugs here and there. It has been proudly built on a Mac and as such is "
"untested in IE.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h1>Instructions</h1>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>Block Regions</h2>\n"
"<p>This theme is the first, as far as I am aware, to use blocks outside of "
"the standard left and right column methodology. There are two addional "
"locations called 'Search/profile' and 'Top Link's.</p>\n"
"<p>The Top Links region is used on the top right of the homepage and can be "
"used for whatever you design. I find HTML blocks with links or spotlighted "
"info works well.</p>\n"
"<p>The Search/Profile region is specifically designed to have either the "
"'Global Search' or the \"Logged in user\" block stored in it. This region is "
"available on all pages\n"
"\n"
"<h2>Logo and Homepage Banner Images</b>\n"
"\n"
"<h2>Color Schemes</h2>\n"
"<p>In the theme settings screen for Rocket you will find you are able to "
"adjust the color of this theme to suit your branding. Both background colors "
"and menu colors can be adjusted as well as the border colors.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h2 Additional Footer Text</h2>\n"
"<p>In the theme settings you can also adjust three additonal text fields. "
"The 'Institution Name' is hsown only on the homepage. This was added as "
"often the name of thei organisation is different to the name of the Moodle "
"site itself.</p>\n"
