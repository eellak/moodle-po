"<h4>Multistyled</h4><h2>A ltr/rtl theme with multiple layout options</h2> - "
"This theme uses multilayout and base themes as parents. Base is part of the "
"Moodle core, but you will need to ensure you have multilayout installed as "
"well (The multilayout theme should have been included in the zip file that "
"this theme was downloaded in and may have been installed to your server at "
"the same time). The theme has been designed to work in browsers from "
"<strong>IE7+ and including FF, Chrome and Safari</strong> - it has also been "
"developed to work with <strong>rtl language layouts</strong>.<br/><br/>The "
"theme allows any one of <strong>5 different layouts</strong> (3column - "
"holygrail/blogstyle, 2 column - left or right sidebars, 1column full width) "
"to be applied either site wide through the setting spage or by duplicating "
"the main general_layout.php file and setting the chosen layout in the code "
"there - these new files can then be referenced from the config.php for "
"different page types as needed. The layouts also have additional block "
"regions above and below the main content region for even greater "
"flexibility.<br/><br/>The settings page for multistyled also gives a "
"selection of <strong>pre-set colour schemes and styles</strong> (such as "
"rounded corners) which can be applied to the theme - alternatively the theme "
"can be styled in detail using the custom css box."
