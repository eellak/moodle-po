"\t\t</div>\n"
"\t\t<div class=\"theme_description\">\n"
"\t\t\t<h2>About</h2>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>Cubic is a fluid-width, three-column theme for Moodle 2.3. Its "
"objective is to provide users with a more user-friendly interface, which "
"provides several forms of social awareness and some new concepts.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<h2>Tweaks</h2>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>This theme is a base theme for Moodle, which introduces some new "
"concepts and which takes advantage of some new technologies like HTML5 and "
"CSS3.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>On the top of every Moodle page, this theme introduces a user bar "
"which provides users with several menus. Each of these menus contain "
"information about the current user courses, activities, notifications, "
"events, messages, settings, and others.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>Besides that, this theme is related to two new Moodle local plugins, "
"which introduce the <a href=\"https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=loca"
"l_institutions\">Institutions</a> and the <a href=\"https://moodle.org/plugins"
"/view.php?plugin=local_applications\">Applications</a> concepts in Moodle. On "
"the user bar a menu for each of those concepts is displayed. Those menus "
"allow the users to access institutional or applications web pages, "
"respectively. Both the institutions and the applications pages can be "
"accessed without leaving Moodle.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>Furthermore, this theme is also related to a new Moodle <a "
"href=\"https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=block_gchat\">block "
"plugin</a> that introduces a chat service for Moodle that is available for "
"everyone, a bit like Google Chat or Facebook Chat.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>Since the user bar contains a lot of useful information, the blocks "
"are no longer required in some contexts. For example, when embedding a page, "
"Cubic uses all horizontal and vertical space leaving only the user bar in "
"the top.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>Finally, this theme also provides a settings page where you can change "
"several properties like logos, colors, system name, and others. On this "
"page you can also remove the institutions and applications menus from the "
"user bar in case you don't want to use them.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<h2>Credits</h2>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>This theme was coded and is maintained by <a "
"href=\"http://pessoa.fct.unl.pt/b.sampaio/index.php?language=en\">Bruno "
"Sampaio</a>. The decision to create this theme was made during his Master "
"thesis, which was related with the use of new technologies on education, "
"mainly video games. Moodle was chosen as a way to distribute educational "
"games developed using <a href=\"http://epik.di.fct.unl.pt/epik\">Epik</a>, and "
"since some studies pointed some problems with its user interface, it was "
"decided to create a new theme to satisfy some of the Personal Learning "
"Environments (PLEs) concepts.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>This theme wouldn't be so great without the help of <b>André Costa</b> "
"which designed the Cubic logo and <b>Sónia Martins</b> which designed some "
"of the icons used. Besides that some of the icons and scripts used are "
"available on the internet.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>You can find the icons in the user bar <a "
"href=\"http://www.iconfinder.com/search/15/?q=iconset%3Asuper-mono-"
"reflection\">here</a> (created by <a "
"href=\"http://www.doublejdesign.co.uk/\">Double-J Design</a>) and the mono "
"chromatic icons <a href=\"http://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=iconset%"
"3Acc_mono_icon_set\">here</a> (created by <a "
"href=\"http://www.gentleface.com/\">GentleFace</a>), both under the <a "
"href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/\">Creative Commons</a> "
"license.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>The Javascript scripts used were the jQuery framework found <a "
"href=\"http://jquery.com/\">here</a>, the jQuery UI found <a "
"href=\"http://jqueryui.com/\">here</a> and the jQuery Custom Scrollbar found "
"<a href=\"http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-"
"scroller\">here</a>.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>If you need help about anything related with this theme just send an "
"e-mail to b.sampaio@campus.fct.unl.pt and I'll try to answer the faster I "
"can.</p>\n"
"\t\t\t<h2>Extras</h2>\n"
"\t\t\t<p>In addition to this theme were also created two blocks. One to display "
"the user favorite Applications. And other with a Global Chat, similar to "
"the one provided by Google and Facebook, for example.</p>\n"
