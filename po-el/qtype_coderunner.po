"The default 'exact match' grader\n"

"value defined\n"
"by the testcase. Trailing white space is stripped from all lines, and any "
"trailing\n"
"blank lines are deleted, before the\n"
"equality test is made.\n"
"\n"
"The near-equality grader is similar except that it\n"
"also collapses multiple spaces and tabs to a single space, deletes all blank\n"
"lines and converts the strings to lower case.\n"
"\n"
"The 'regular expression' grader uses the 'expected'\n"
"field of the test case as a regular expression and tests the output to see\n"
"if a match to the expected result can be found anywhere within the output.\n"
"To force matching of the entire output, start and end the regular expression\n"
"with '\\A' and '\\Z' respectively. Regular expression matching uses MULTILINE\n"
"and DOTALL options.\n"
"\n"
"The 'template grader' option assumes that the output\n"
"from the program is actually a\n"
"grading result, i.e. that the template not tests *and grades* the student "
"answer.\n"
"The only output from such a template program must be a JSON-encoded record.\n"
"\n"
"If the template is a per-test template (i.e., not a combinator), the JSON "
"string must describe a row of the\n"
"results table and should contain at least a 'fraction' field, which is "
"multiplied by TEST.mark to decide how\n"
"many marks the test case is awarded. It should usually also contain a 'got'\n"
"field, which is the value displayed in the 'Got' column of the results "
"table.\n"
"The other columns of the results table (testcode, stdin, expected) can also\n"
"be defined by the template grading program and will be used instead of the "
"values from\n"
"the testcase. As an example, if the output of the program is the string\n"
"`{\"fraction\":0.5, \"got\": \"Half the answers were right!\"}`, half marks would "
"be\n"
"given for that particular test case and the 'Got' column would display the\n"
"text \"Half the answers were right!\". Other columns can be added to the "
"result\n"
"table by adding extra attributes to the JSON record and also to the "
"question's\n"
"Result Columns field.\n"
"\n"
"If the template is a combinator, the JSON string output by the template "
"grader\n"
"should again contain a 'fraction' field, this time for the total mark,\n"
"and may contain zero or more of 'prologuehtml', 'testresults',\n"
"'epiloguehtml' and 'showdifferences'.\n"
"The 'prologuehtml' and 'epiloguehtml' fields are html\n"
"that is displayed respectively before and after the (optional) result table. "
"The\n"
"'testresults' field, if given, is a list of lists used to display some sort\n"
"of result table. The first row is the column-header row and all other rows\n"
"define the table body. Two special column header values exist: 'iscorrect'\n"
"and 'ishidden'. The 'iscorrect' column(s) are used to display ticks or\n"
"crosses for 1 or 0 row values respectively. The 'ishidden' column isn't\n"
"actually displayed but 0 or 1 values in the column can be used to turn on "
"and\n"
"off row visibility. Students do not see hidden rows but markers and other\n"
"staff do. The 'showdifferences' field turns on display of a 'Show "
"Differences'\n"
"button after the results table if the awarded mark fraction is not 1.0."

"template code is responsible for splitting the output itself, and grading "
"it.\n"
"\n"
"Combinator templates do not get passed a TEST Twig variable. Instead they\n"
"receive a variable TESTCASES, which is a list of all the tests in the\n"

"is present, falling back to running each test separately. This does not\n"
