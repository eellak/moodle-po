"Are you ready for the exaclick challenge? Try to recognize what you see on "
"these pictures and answer the questions. Here is what you need to do:<br "
"/>1. Click “Start” and a hidden image will appear. Tiles will gradually drop "
"revealing more and more of the image/clip.<br />2. If you think you know "
"enough, click “Stop”, the earlier you click “Stop” the higher your score "
"will be. – But watch out!  If you click too early you might not yet see "
"enough to answer the question!<br />3. Answer the pertaining question before "
"time runs out.  You have 40 seconds to answer each question. You will get a "
"higher score for more difficult questions and the faster you answer. Give a "
"wrong answer and you will lose a life.<br />4. Keep on going until the end "
"of the game<br />The questions will get more and more difficult. Be careful, "
"you only have three lives. Only the most courageous and clever learners "
"will be able to break the high-score. May the force be with you!"

"Exabis-Games currently consist of three different games:\n"
"\n"
"* braingame - here Moodle-Tests are enhanced with a funny Flash-animation. "
"The goal is to catapult the scientist into outer space - by not answering "
"all questions correctly he only falls into the water!\n"
"* exaclick uncovers a hidden picture/clip for the player. If the "
"\"stop\"-button is clicked - time stops and a Moodle-quiz-question has to be "
"answered. This question has to be configured at the beginning by the trainer "
"with the Flash-editor in the \"configure questions\"-tab.<br /><br "
"/>ATTENTION: the game only accepts links to files that are accessible for "
"students within Moodle, i.e. from within a course-folder. the picture/clip "
"has to be uploaded before question-configuration.\n"
"* gamelabs.at - this Opensource online-adventure-creator enables you to "
"create small adventures based upon any subject. Games that have been created "
"(by a trainer or a student) can be embedded into Moodle here."
