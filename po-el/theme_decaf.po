"<h3>About</h3>\n"
"<p>Decaf is a three-column, fluid-width theme for Moodle that was created by "
"<a href=\"http://moodle.org/user/view.php?id=390408\">Lei Zhang</a>.\n"
"It improves usability by shifting setting blocks to top of the page, so "
"called \"Moodle awesome bar\".\n"
"For developers, It transfers the performance info into a colorful floated "
"bar at bottom of the page, which brings the performance awareness as well as "
"improves usability.</p>\n"
"<h3>Parents</h3>\n"
"<p>This theme is based upon the Bootstrap theme, which was created for "
"Moodle 2.5, with the help of:<br>\n"
"Stuart Lamour, Mark Aberdour, Paul Hibbitts, Mary Evans.</p>\n"
"<h3>Theme Credits</h3>\n"
