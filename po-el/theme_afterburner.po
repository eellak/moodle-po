"  <h2>About</h2>\n"
"  <p>Afterburner is a three-column, fluid-width theme coded for Moodle 2.0. "
"It makes use of custom menus that appear below the site title on every page. "
"An added function, which allows users to login and logout, has now been "
"integrated into the custom menu for this theme.</p>\n"
"  <h2>Parents</h2>\n"
"  <p>This theme is built on Base, a parent theme included in the Moodle "
"core. If you wish to modify aspects of this theme, beyond the settings "
"offered, we advise creating a new theme using this theme and Base theme as "
"parent themes, so any updates to these parent themes, in the core, will find "
"their way into your new theme.</p>\n"
"  <h2>Credits</h2>\n"

"NewSchool Learning (www.newschoollearning.com)from an original design by "
