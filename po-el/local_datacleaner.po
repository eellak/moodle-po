"The data cleaner uses a heuristic to create cascade delete rules in the "
"database that\n"
"aren't normally there. Prior to creating a rule, it checks how many records "
"would violate the potential relationship. This setting\n"
"controls the threshold above which the relationship will not be created "
"(which also means records in the target table will not be\n"
"deleted). The threshold is expressed as a percentage of the total number of "
"records involved. If the total number of records in a\n"
" table is less than 100, this value is ignored and any conflicts cause the "
"rule not to be created."
