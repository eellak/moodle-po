"This module provide students a way of fast memoizing list of \"things\". This "

"sounds.\n"
"</p>\n"
"<p>\n"
"This module implements a full Leitner system to mechanically support the "
"memoization process\n"
"of the relationships. The couples to be learned are first attached to a deck "
"of cards. These are\n"
"initially considered as difficult to learn. The teacher can choose a "
"learning curve using 2, 3 or 4 decks.\n"
"4 decks should be used for large set of definitions. When the student fails "
"answering a card, he will\n"
"tell it and let the card stay in the same deck. If he has the correct "
"answer, he will ask for passing the\n"
"card to the second deck, so considered as less difficult to learn. The "
"process is repeated for all decks\n"
"till the last one where card will remain. The decks are triggered so the "
"student knows which he should\n"
"review. Difficult cards will trigger more often thant trivial cards. Trigger "
"delays are adjustable.\n"
