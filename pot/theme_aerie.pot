"class=\"theme_description\"><h2>About</h2><p>Aerie is a fluid-width, three-"
"column theme for Moodle 2, with six extra positions for blocks (three top "
"and three bottom). The custom menu contains a Home link which always appears "
"to the very left, and a My courses and Login/Logout link, which appears "
"after any administrator-added items.</p><p>Aerie has a settings page that "
"lets you modify various background colours, custom footer, custom css, and "
"the site logo.</p><h2>Tweaks</h2><p>This theme is built upon Base, a parent "
"theme included in the Moodle core. If you want to modify Aerie, we recommend "
"that you first duplicate it then rename it before making your changes. This "
"means you'll still have the original files if you make a mistake. More "
"information on modifying themes can be found in the <a href=\"http://docs.moo"
"dle.org/en/Theme\">MoodleDocs</a>.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>This theme was coded "
