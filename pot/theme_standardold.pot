"This theme is designed specifically to work on IE6 and other old browsers.\n"
"\n"
"The Moodle 2.0 release notes state that IE6 is no longer supported however "
"we have not gone out of our way to ensure it does not work and as such it "
"should in the most part work fine barring numerous minor visual issues.\n"
"\n"
"This theme is here so that those who are stuck with IE6 can still have a "
"usable theme, although specific areas of Moodle may still cause problems or "
"fail to function correctly.\n"
"It differs from the standard theme only by the layouts, rather than using "
"the floating div layout that puts the content first this theme uses a table "
"for layout much like the theme's in Moodle 1.9.\n"
"\n"
"Because IE6 is not supported Moodle HQ will not be spending copious amounts "
"of time on getting it 100% functional. Please if you find a bug with IE6 and "
"this theme - find a solution as well. Then create a bug report at "
"tracker.moodle.org and provide both a detailed example of where to find and "
"how to replicate the bug as well as the solution you found. This way we can "
"continue to improve the theme and it's IE6 support."
