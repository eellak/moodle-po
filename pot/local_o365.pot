"<b>How Multitenancy Works:</b><br />Multitenancy allows multiple Office 365 "
"tenants to access your Moodle site. <br /><br />\n"
"    Here's how to get set up:\n"
"    <ol>\n"
"        <li>Log in to Moodle as a administrator user that is not using the "
"OpenID Connect authentication plugin.</li>\n"
"        <li>Disable the OpenID Connect authentication plugin in Moodle. (Use "
"<a href=\"{$a}/admin/settings.php?section=manageauths\">the authentication "
"plugins administration page</a>.)</li>\n"
"        <li>Navigate to Azure AD, and find the application you configured "
"for Moodle.</li>\n"
"        <li>Enable multitenancy in the Azure AD application and save "
"changes.</li>\n"
"        <li>For each tenant you want to enable, click \"Add New Tenant\" and "
"log in with an administrator account from the tenant you want to "
"enable.</li>\n"
"        <li>Once you have added all the tenants you want, re-enable the "
"OpenID Connect authentication plugin in Moodle.</li>\n"
"        <li>You're done! To add additional tenants in the future, just click "
"the \"Add New Tenant\" button and log in with an administrator account from "
"that tenant.</li>\n"
"    </ol>\n"

"tenants to access your application when enabled. Adding the tenants here "
"allows us to restrict Moodle access to tenants you configure. <b>If you "
