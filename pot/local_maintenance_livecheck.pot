"With this setting, you can set a back off time (in seconds) in which the "
"users' browsers will not perform any check yet. It can be used to reduce the "
"load on the server side and is best described with an example: If you "
"always schedule the maintenance mode with 10 minutes lead time and have set "
"the live check interval to 60 seconds, you could set the live check back off "
"time to 120 seconds. The users' browsers will then perform the first live "
"check 180 seconds after page load. Thus, the users will be notified 7 "
"minutes before maintenance mode is started in the worst case which should be "
"enough for most scenarios."

"With this setting, you can set the interval (in seconds) in which the users' "
"browsers will check if maintenance mode will be enabled soon or has been "
"enabled in the meantime. Even if this check is very lightweight on the "
"server side, you should be careful with really short intervals because short "
"intervals, together with a large amount of concurrent active users, might "
"generate perceivable additional load on your server. For normal Moodle "
"setups, the default setting should be fine."
