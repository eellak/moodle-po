"This tool creates standard test courses that include many\n"
"sections, activities, and files.\n"
"\n"
"This is intended to provide a standardised measure for checking the "
"reliability\n"
"and performance of various system components (such as backup and restore).\n"
"\n"
"This test is important because there have been many cases previously where,\n"
"faced with real-life use cases (e.g. a course with 1,000 activities), the "
"system\n"
"does not work.\n"
"\n"
"Courses created using this feature can occupy a large amount of database and\n"
"filesystem space (tens of gigabytes). You will need to delete the courses\n"
"(and wait for various cleanup runs) to release this space again.\n"
"\n"
"**Do not use this feature on a live system**. Use only on a developer "
"server.\n"
"(To avoid accidental use, this feature is disabled unless you have also "
"selected\n"
"DEVELOPER debugging level.)"
