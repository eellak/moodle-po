"class=\"theme_description\"><h2>About</h2><p>Strawberry is a fluid-width, "
"three-column theme for Moodle 2.2 or higher. The custom menu contains a Home "
"link which always appears to the very left, and a My courses and "
"Login/Logout link, which appears after any administrator-added "
"items.</p><p>Strawberry has a settings page that lets you modify various "
"background colours, custom footer, custom css, and the site "
"logo.</p><h2>Tweaks</h2><p>This theme is built upon Base, a parent theme "
"included in the Moodle core. If you want to modify Strawberry, we recommend "
"that you first duplicate it then rename it before making your changes. This "
"means you'll still have the original files if you make a mistake. More "
"information on modifying themes can be found in the <a href=\"http://docs.moo"
"dle.org/en/Theme\">MoodleDocs</a>.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>This theme uses the "
"design of Strawberry theme from <a href=\"http://www.templatemo.com\" "
"target=\"_blank\">Templatemo.com</a>, but none of the actual code from that "
"theme was used.</p><p>Images are from the Strawberry theme from Templatemo, "
"except the default banner. That image is attributed to <a "
"href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/w-j-s\" target=\"_blank\">W.J.S on "
"Flickr</a>. The image allows for non-commercial use with "
"attribution.</p><p>This theme was coded and is maintained by Miriam Laidlaw "
"of HRDNZ. She can be contacted by email at miriam@hrdnz.com.</p></div></div>"
