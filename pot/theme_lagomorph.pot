"<p><span style='font-size: x-large;'><strong>Lagomorph "
"Theme</strong></span></p><p>This theme has been devloped to provide a basis "
"for a single theme across a wide variety of screen sizes, from full desktop "
"down to mobile phone, although the prime focus is intended to be on "
"flexibility onto mobile devices, such as android tablets/iPad etc.</p>\n"
"<p>To achieve this the theme relies considerably on css3 and so "
"<em><strong>IS NOT SUITABLE</strong></em> for older browsers, especially "
"'older' IE variations. MS filters have been used to replicate some standard "
"css3 features as near as possible to attempt to give a similar user "
"experience, although some have not proved practical (e.g. there is no "
"gradient on the block headers in IE as I have been unable to make the "
"gradient filter allow for the rounded corners)</p>\n"
"<p><strong>Points to note:</strong></p>\n"
"<p><strong>1</strong>. The page layout uses '@media screen' calls and is "
"based on Daniel Wahl's work on the ReBase theme. This allows the page to "
"automatically adjust between 3 column (for larger screen widths), 2 columns "
"(left/main) for smaller screens and a single column where the side-blocks "
"appear under the main content on the smallest screens. The profile block is "
"also adapted according to screen size - showing the profile pic on large "
"screens, but only the username on smaller screens</p>\n"
"<p><strong>2</strong>. The main menu for the theme is a single menu bar (ie "
"no dropdowns), populated from a text file which can be loaded via the "
"theme's settings page. This menu automatically adjusts to become a dropdown "
"select style menu on smaller screens, and resizes to make it usable by touch "
"control on very small screens. The standard moodle2 custommenu can also be "
"added from an option on the theme's settings page, although this is "
"currently set not to be shown on small screens, particularly as the hover "
"style drop downs used are not suitable for touch control.</p>\n"
"<p><strong>3</strong>. To reduce the download times and html calls on mobile "
"devices, css gradients/shadows/rounded corners/etc. and very few graphics "
"have been used to create the theme. Those that are included (main picture "
"top right, and block header icons) on larger screens are removed on the "
"smallest layouts. this is based on the assumption that full screen use is "
"more likely to be wired/wireless ethernet based, while smaller devices "
"become more likely to rely on mobile broadband services</p>\n"
"<p><strong>4</strong>. I new icon set has been applied, based on the fugue "
"icon set by Yusuke Kamiyamane. The fugue icon set is released under a "
"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence. This has been done to try to "
"improve the general look and feel and has no bearing on the theme's "
"usefulness in a mobile environment! :) Where these icons have been used to "
"decorate block headers, they are removed on smaller screen sizes where the "
"site may be being accessed over mobile broadband services in order to reduce "
"page download times.</p>\n"
"<p><strong>5</strong>. As a design idea that arose during discussions for "
"Shaun Daubney's new Aardvark2.1 theme, I have included new block areas, 2 "
"above the main content and 2 below in the center column. This allows greater "
"flexibility in the arrangement of the page and also allows the option for "
"important blocks to be positioned above the main content even when the site "
"is reduced to a single column on the smallest screens.</p>\n"

"<p>Lagomorph uses a limited colour set to create the gradients, backgrounds "
