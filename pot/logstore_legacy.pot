"This plugin records log data to the legacy log table (mdl_log). This "
"functionality has been replaced by newer, richer and more efficient logging "
"plugins, so you should only run this plugin if you have old custom reports "
"that directly query the old log table. Writing to the legacy logs will "
"increase load, so it is recommended that you disable this plugin for "
"performance reasons when it is not needed."
