"<h2>About</h2>\n"
"<p>Aardvark Post-IT is a three column fluid-width theme for Moodle 2.2+ by "
"Mary Evans, based on the original Aardvark 2.1 theme by Shauun Daubney.</p>\n"
"<h2>Tweaks</h2>\n"
"<p>If you want to modify this theme, we recommend that you first duplicate "
"it, then rename it before making your changes. This will prevent your "
"customised theme from being overwritten by future Moodle upgrades, and "
"you'll still have the original files if you make a mess. More information on "
"modifying themes can be found in the <a "
"href=\"http://docs.moodle.org/en/Theme\">MoodleDocs</a>.</p>"
