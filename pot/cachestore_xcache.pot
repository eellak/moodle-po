"This sets a maximum TTL on all entries stored in the cache. This ensures "
"that items within the cache do not get stale. Setting this to 0 will ensure "
"a TTL is not set and items will stay in the cache until removed. Please note "
"that when set to 0 we can be sure that data set to the cache is available "
"however you run a greater risk of filling the cache and experiencing "
