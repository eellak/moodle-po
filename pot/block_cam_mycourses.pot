"<li>Full: This displays the course with full overview information provided "
"by modules inside the course such as Assignment due dates</li>\n"
"<li>Listing: This displays a list of the courses inside this category with "
"no extra information</li>\n"
"<li>Full if enrolled: This displays the course with full overview "
"information, if not enrolled in the listed course it will only show the "
"course name.</li>\n"
