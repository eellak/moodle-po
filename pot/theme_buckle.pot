"<h3>About</h3>\n"
"<p>buckle is a modified Moodle bootstrap theme which inherits styles and "
"renderers from its parent theme.</p>\n"
"<h3>Parents</h3>\n"
"<p>This theme is based upon the Bootstrap theme, which was created for "
"Moodle 2.5, with the help of:<br>\n"
"Stuart Lamour, Mark Aberdour, Paul Hibbitts, Mary Evans.</p>\n"
"<p>It also builds on the work of the Clean theme by Mary Evans and uses the "
"responsive pagelayout structure from Krystle - orginally used from Danny "
"Wahls Zebra theme and based on the Matthew James Taylor Holy Grail "
"layouts</p>\n"
"<h3>Theme Credits</h3>\n"
"<p>See above for credits for parent themes and work built on from other "
"themes - All credit goes to those developers, while all errors in teh theme "
"I keep for myself!</p>\n"
