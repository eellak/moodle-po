"Choose the type of grading calculation.\n"
"\n"
"**All or nothing**\n"
": If all items are in the correct position, then full marks are awarded. "
"Otherwise, the score is zero.\n"
"\n"
"**Absolute position**\n"
": An item is considered correct if it is in the same position as in the "
"correct answer. The highest possible score for the question is **the same "
"as** the number of items displayed to the student.\n"
"\n"
"**Relative to correct position**\n"
": An item is considered correct if it is in the same position as in the "
"correct answer. Correct items receive a score equal to the number of items "
"displayed minus one. Incorrect items receive a score equal to the number of "
"items displayed minus one and minus the distance of the item from its "
"correct position. Thus, if ***n*** items are displayed to the student, the "
"number of marks available for each item is ***(n - 1)***, and the highest "
"mark available for the question is ***n x (n - 1)***, which is the same as "
"***(n² - n)***.\n"
"\n"
"**Relative to the next item (excluding last)**\n"
": An item is considered correct if it is followed by the same item as it is "
"in the correct answer. The item in the last position is not checked. Thus, "
"the highest possible score for the question is **one less than** the number "
"of items displayed to the student.\n"
"\n"
"**Relative to the next item (including last)**\n"
": An item is considered correct if it is followed by the same item as it is "
"in the correct answer. This includes the last item which must have no item "
"following it. Thus, the highest possible score for the question is **the "
"same as** the number of items displayed to the student.\n"
"\n"
"**Relative to both the previous and next items**\n"
": An item is considered correct if both the previous and next items are the "
"same as they are in the correct answer. The first item should have no "
"previous item, and the last item should have no next item. Thus, there are "
"two possible points for each item, and the highest possible score for the "
"question is **twice** the number of items displayed to the student.\n"
"\n"
"**Relative to ALL previous and next items**\n"
": An item is considered correct if it is preceded by all the same items as "
"it is in the correct answer, and it is followed by all the same items as it "
"is in the correct answer. The order of the previous items does not matter, "
"and nor does the order of the following items. Thus, if ***n*** items are "
"displayed to the student, the number of marks available for each item is "
"***(n - 1)***, and the highest mark available for the question is ***n x (n "
"- 1)***, which is the same as ***(n² - n)***.\n"
"\n"
"**Longest ordered subset**\n"
": The grade is the number of items in the longest ordered subset of items. "
"The highest possible grade is the same as the number of items displayed. A "
"subset must have at least two items. Subsets do not need to start at the "
"first item (but they can) and they do not need to be contiguous (but they "
"can be). Where there are multiple subsets of equal length, items in the "
"subset that is found first, when searching from left to right, will be "
"displayed as correct. Other items will be marked as incorrect.\n"
"\n"
"**Longest contiguous subset**\n"
": The grade is the number of items in the longest contiguous subset of "
"items. The highest possible grade is the same as the number of items "
"displayed. A subset must have at least two items. Subsets do not need to "
"start at the first item (but they can) and they MUST BE CONTIGUOUS. Where "
"there are multiple subsets of equal length, items in the subset that is "
"found first, when searching from left to right, will be displayed as "
"correct. Other items will be marked as incorrect."
